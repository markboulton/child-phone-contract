# A Child's Phone Contract

## The four main rules

- This phone is primarily for your safety. Be responsible for knowing how to call for help and when.
- Keep your phone on you.
- We will always know your password and will check the browser history and messages from time to time.
- Always answer and/or return messages or phone calls from Mum and Dad.


## Using this phone

- If it rings, answer it. Be polite. Never hang up on someone you know.
- Treat it carefully and respectfully. If it breaks, you are responsible for its repair.
- You understand you are responsible for knowing where your phone is at all times and keep it charged at all times.
- No phones at times when it’s not acceptable; during mealtimes, at the cinema or in a restaurant. Try to remember there are other ways to entertain yourself when you are waiting for someone or something.
- Be in the moment, not in your phone. For example: don't look at your phone and walk at the same time. You'll walk into a lamp-post or some dog poo. Your dad has done both. Learn from his stupidity.


## This phone and our family

- Your sister is younger and not yet ready to have a phone. Don’t use your phone to tease or taunt her. Don’t boast or deliberately make her feel jealous or left out.
- The phone will go in the kitchen drawer one hour before bedtime every night and not come out until morning.
- Wifi at home will be on and available between the hours of 8am and 7pm daily.
- Mum and Dad have brought you up to be interested in the world around you. You love reading, drawing, being outside and music amongst other things. Don’t replace these things with your phone. Instead, use your phone to enhance and expand your hobbies.


## This phone and other people

- Do not text, email or say anything using this phone that you wouldn't say in person.
- Do not send threatening or mean messages to others.
- Follow your school rules on mobile phones.
- Do not lend your phone to anyone.
- Promise you will tell Mum and Dad when you receive suspicious phone calls or messages from people you don't know.
- If you see anything that scares you, or makes you uncomfortable, speak to Mum and Dad. You won’t be punished for asking for help.
- Be careful about who you tell your phone number to.


## Using the web and apps

- The web is an amazing place. Use the web for things you would openly share with us. Practice safe, responsible digital behaviour.
- Your personal email address is just that: personal. Be careful about who you share it with.
- Social media can be both wonderful and awful. What you post online stays online and so you are not allowed to have a profile on any social media channel until you are old enough. Until then, you will not allow your friends to post pictures or videos of you on social channels. In return, Mum and Dad will check with you before we post anything online about you or on your behalf.

## Three strikes

- We will operate a three strikes and out policy. Any breach of this agreement will result in a warning. After three warnings, the phone will be confiscated for 24 hours.
